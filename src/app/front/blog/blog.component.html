                Adding tiles that span multiple rows or columns

It is possible to set the rowspan and colspan of each md-grid-tile individually, using the rowspan and colspan properties. If not set, they both default to 1. The colspan must not exceed the number of cols in the md-grid-list. There is no such restriction on the rowspan however, more rows will simply be added for it the tile to fill.

ubuntu environment path
so type "echo $PATH" and check your path, if npm/bin isnt there add it again through the bash_profile.

touch ~/.bash_profile
open ~/.bash_profile
export PATH="/Users/xxxxxx/npm/bin:$PATH"
save and close bash_profile
go to terminal and type "source ~/.bash_profile" that will update your PATH
"echo $PATH" and check if npm/bin path is there.

this is for the copy of the default 
default path  export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin
here is a sample, default .bashrc file located in /etc/skel - you could make a backup of your current .bashrc with mv .bashrc .bashrc.bak and then cp /etc/skel/.bashrc .bashrc to copy that sample back to your home directory. After that, un-comment force_color_prompt=yes in the new file and add [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" back to the end (last line) of the file so that RVM still works.
After that, execute . .bashrc at a prompt to reload your bash profile, which should give you a colored prompt again and test RVM with the command type rvm | head -1 which should return the text: rvm is a function
